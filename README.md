# Dot Files
My dot files shared between machines.

## Installation
Run [`script/setup`](https://github.com/johnbhall/dotfiles/blob/master/script/setup)
after checkout to symlink (or copy) everything in this directory to your home directory.

## MacOS Defaults
I can't yet figure out how to do this through strap. For now, run `./script/setup-macos.sh`

## Status
I'm using these on all my personal machines.
